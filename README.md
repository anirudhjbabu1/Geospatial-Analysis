## Introduction
This project provides a comprehensive geospatial analysis of Indian cities using Python and various geospatial libraries. The analysis is performed in a Google Colab notebook, making it easy to run and reproduce the results without any local setup. The notebook includes data visualization, spatial analysis, and insights on various geospatial aspects of Indian cities.

## Features
- Interactive maps using Folium and Plotly
- Spatial data processing and analysis
- Visualization of geographic data
- Analysis of urban patterns and trends

## Getting Started
To get started with the geospatial analysis, simply open the Colab notebook using the link provided below and follow the instructions within the notebook.
